    "Your first task is to develop and evaluate a classifier to see how well a speed profile can be determined from the load sensor data.  Specifically, you are asked to use the load sensor data X from turbine sensors (14 parameters in the Appendix) to classify the wind speed profiles: 0, 1, 2, 3 (your Y estimator output).  Be sure to include estimates of how well your classifier performs."

Create a predictive model for $\\alpha$ from the load sensor data and determine how well it estimates the actual. In this case, you are using the same X load sensor inputs to infer a new continuous variable Y."
